    <h3>I have been looking for a platform like this to use.</h3>
    <span class="byline">WRITTEN BY: Zach Heywood</span>
    <p>I have been trying to find a platform to use for months. I pursued many google searches. But none of them led to anything worth using. In fact, all of the information that I found never actually worked. That could have been user error. But GitHub is great! it's so easy to use. and once you actually start using it, programing and developement become so much easier over time!</p>
